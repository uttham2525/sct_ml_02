K-mean clustering algorithm
# Customer Segmentation Using KMeans

## Overview
This project focuses on implementing a *K-means clustering algorithm* to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history. Customer segmentation is a crucial step in understanding customer behavior, improving marketing strategies, and increasing business efficiency.

## Problem Statement
Group customers into meaningful clusters using their purchase history. The goal is to help businesses understand different customer segments and tailor their strategies accordingly.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python). It contains details about customer purchases, which serve as the basis for clustering.

## Requriments
- *Python*
- *Jupyter Notebook*
- *Pandas*: For data manipulation and analysis
- *NumPy*: For numerical computations
- *seaborn*: provides a high-level interface 
- *Matplotlib*: For data visualization
- *Scikit-learn*: For implementing the K-means clustering algorithm

## Key Features
- Preparing the data by managing missing values and standardizing features.
- Applying the K-means clustering algorithm for segmentation.
- Identifying the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method.
- Creating visualizations to interpret and explore customer segments.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/Customer Segmentation Using KMeans.git
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   bash
   cd customer-segmentation
   
3. Install the required dependencies:
   bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   bash
   jupyter notebook Task_02.ipynb
   
2. Follow the steps in the notebook to load the dataset, preprocess it, and perform clustering.

## Results
- Analyzing customer clusters based on purchasing patterns.
- Creating visual representations to highlight the unique traits of each cluster.
